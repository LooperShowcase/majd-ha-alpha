      Founded on 6 March 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has
      traditionally worn a white home kit since inception. The honorific title
      real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso
      XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. The team has
      played its home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium
      in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities,
      Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout
      its history.
